            <p class="top">Graphic designer, visual communicator and lover of all things art. I have been creating and expressing myself ever since I could pick up a crayon. Art has played a large role in my life whether it's sketching, drawing, painting, digital art, or photography. Art allows me to escape from the stress of every day life. I am always learning and searching for ways to improve and reinvent myself and my artwork. Never trust someone who thinks they know everything and thinks they are the best.</p>
        
            <p>I was born in Spokane, Washington in 1993 and raised in a small rural area north of Spokane called Nine Mile Falls. Throughout my schooling I was involved in music (symphonic, marching and jazz band) and took art, photography, digital art and web design classes. These interests didn't end when the bell sounded, I committed hours upon hours to these outside of school as my own personal hobbies.</p>
        
            <p>Fast forward I am a student at Eastern Washington University and will be graduating in 2017 with a Bachelors of Art in Visual Communication Design. It's been an amazing experience and I owe it to the wonderful professors that make up the program. </p>
           
            <p>I was always told by my loving mother that I should "do graphic design" for college but I scoffed and said "thats CRAZY why would I want to turn my favorite pass time into a career?!" Stubborn me having a love for technology and coding (web design), I set off in Computer Science. While it was interesting and I loved every bit of it I soon started to feel this deep unseatedness that this was not the career path for myself. Perhaps I should have listened to Mum.</p>
        
            <p>Upon a friend's request I stumbled into my first two design classes. For the first time I was surrounded by dozens of like-minded creatives. I thought to myself, "This is where I belong, these are MY people!" I am so thankful to turn my biggest passion, love and hobby into a career.</p>
        
            <p>It's been rough and trying at times, but five years later I've made it to the end and enthusiastic and passionate as ever! My true journey as an artist and designer has only begun. I look forward to all the new experiences that are ahead of me! Please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> for any collaborations, questions or business inquiries.</p>
